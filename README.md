[bug] Code only works in ubuntu vm. I belive the error is because I treat a pointer like it's an array. Will be fixed in the next update

The plan is to implement a few versions of the vigen√®re cipher.
It will include a key generator, letter frequency analysis, and ciphertext storage for cracking one-time-pads.
