Version 2

There is now a basic Letter Frequency Analysis tool.
I supplied an example ciphertext to test it with, taken from a book :)

I'm still looking for memory bugs, though it looks relativly good. Please let me know if you find any.

Future updates will include a vigen√®re cipher and will remove useless LFA functions. 
The LFA command will also be given a "save progress" funtionality which will let the cracked ciphertext be saved.

bugs:
you can't do the ctrl+shift+c copy short cut (i think), last I tried, it canceled out the program. Storing the output to a file should restore the progress.
